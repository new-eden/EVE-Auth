# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests
1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch for each feature and/or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the master branch.

It's very important that new features and improvements are implemented in their own separate branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.
This allows us to review and pull in new improvements individually.

## Style Guide
All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2 Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).
